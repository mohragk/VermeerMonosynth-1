/*
This model is based on a reference implementation of an algorithm developed by
Stefano D'Angelo and Vesa Valimaki, presented in a paper published at ICASSP in 2013.
This improved model is based on a circuit analysis and compared against a refddderence
Ngspice simulation. In the paper, it is noted that this particular model is
more accurate in preserving the self-oscillating nature of the real filter.
